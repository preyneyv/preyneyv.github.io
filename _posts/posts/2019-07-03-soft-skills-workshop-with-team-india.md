title: Soft Skills Workshop with Team India
tags: [WorldSkills]
---

Last weekend, I attended a team building workshop with Team India for [WorldSkills Kazan](https://worldskills2019.com/en/). Having previously attended similar workshops in my school, I had a certain idea of what the sessions would consist of.

My expectations involved activities that required everyone to collaborate in order to be completed, such as Spider's Web. Through these tasks, we would pick up leadership ideas that we could implement in the future. We would also be more comfortable with each other in the future.

Day 1 came around and we opened _strong_. The best part certainly had to be a talk by the competitor for Restaurant Service from the previous iteration of this contest. The way he spoke was very informal and unfiltered, and I think that allowed us all to relate to him a lot better.

He talked about his preparation, his performance, his mistakes, but the part that resonated with almost everyone was this:

> The four WorldSkills days are not going to come back. Do not leave anything as "could have". You will **never** get a chance to change it.

He spoke about a mistake that he made, something that seemed like common sense in hindsight, but just did not strike him at the time. Part of his task involved adding ice into a cocktail shaker, but instead of moving the shaker closer to the ice tub, he moved the ice cubes one by one. One of the times he was doing this, the ice cube fell and the evaluators deducted his marks.

His talk was powerful because it was raw, it was real.

The next day, we played a game called the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. This was a very complicated optimization problem which needed us to divide up the duties and execute our individual responsibilities perfectly. The objective was simple: gather the most amount of gold as possible. What made it tricky was the number of choices and variables.

It really brought out the importance of planning, teamwork, and collaboration, because, without all of these, the task would be near-impossible.

The last day was a fun one. We broke up into small teams and were given the task of building a catapult out of PVC pipes, rubber bands, and rope. The objective was to make the catapult that shoots the furthest.

This activity required both good planning and good execution. We also got to see the various thought processes of competitors and experts with different backgrounds and participating in different skill contests.

We then had a talk by a kickboxer who came up from practically nothing and went on to win gold medals. Every motivational speech talks about "believing in yourself", but his talk was exceptional because he was a living example of that.

It's not what he said that motivated me, it was what he was. Having said that, his talk was still engaging, sprinkled with humor. His talk was definitely _the_ highlight of the three days.

Finally, we did an activity called "Fee Fi Fo Fum", where a handful of people had to go around acting like hungry giants in front of the rest of Team India. The objective was to bring people out of their shells and to worry less about what others thought. Needless to say, the activity was hilarious to watch and a bit frightening to do.

A lot more happened in the three days, but I only included the things that were the most impactful for me. Also, the previous team-building workshops I attended were with a group of around twenty people. I always walked out of those sessions feeling like close friends with those twenty people. As I mentioned at the start, I expected to be comfortable with the rest of the team.

What I did not expect, however, was a feeling of extended family towards _about 100 people_.
