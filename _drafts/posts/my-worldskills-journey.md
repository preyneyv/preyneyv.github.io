<span class="timeline">2014</span>

Way back in 2014, 12-year-old me enrolled in a course on web development, because why not. It started off a bit bumpy and very confusing, but slowly I was getting the hang of it. By the end of the two-month course, I wouldn't say I was _good_ at web dev, but I was definitely interested.

Programming gave me the window to build _anything_ I wanted to, to do _anything_ I felt like doing. That idea was very fascinating to me back then, just as it is right now. The best analogy I could come up with is like getting a box of Legos; you could spend hours and hours bringing things that only existed in your mind into reality.

So, the course ended, but then the training institute told me about a contest called WorldSkills Competition. They told me it was this really cool international contest for web development and other skills. I decided to give it a shot, for what it was worth. I had no idea what I was getting myself into (in the good way).

Later that year, the regional round happened. Lucky me, it happened in Bangalore, where I stay, meaning I didn't have to travel very far at all to participate.

The contest was composed of multiple modules, with each one testing a certain aspect of web development such as layout, interaction, database and backend. All this had to happen without internet access and under a very restrictive time limit. The competition also had an age limit of under 22 (good thing I didn't need to worry about that :P)

By chance _(no honestly, I don't know how this happened)_, I got third place in the regionals (all of South India!), so I was through to the nationals. The south regionals winner was called Chirag Goel and he was another Bangalorean. He becomes important later.

So I was off to Mumbai to participate in the nationals, as excited as ever. I met all sorts of cool people, but long story short, I ended up sixth. Not at all demotivated (since I knew I could go again), I happily went back home, knowing that I'd try again next time. I was getting homesick anyways...

2015 rolls by and Chirag (who won the nationals) goes on to represent India in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the international round. My life goes on as normal, but I stay in touch with web development, waiting my turn (since the contest is biennial and not annual).

<span class="timeline">2016</span>

I applied for the contest again. "This time for real", I told my self. "I'm ready."

I frequently contacted Chirag, getting his opinions on everything that I was doing, from design to code structure. 

The south regionals happened in Bangalore again (yay!) and I got first place (double yay!). I went to the nationals (in Delhi this time). Ready to prove myself, two years in the making, I went all out, giving it my best shot and I gotâ€¦ second place.

I was a little disappointed the second time, because I genuinely thought I gave it all I thought I could. I was sad, and unsure whether or not I wanted to participate again. I never gave up on web development, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to dedicate so much time to WorldSkills once more.

I used the skillset I acquired from WorldSkills at school by making small apps to make life simpler, such as a voting app to nominate the Student Council (hint: keep an eye out for this article!)

But then, I thought to myself, "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I have to take it." I made up my mind.

<span class="timeline">2018</span>

I once again continuously bother Chirag, slowly getting better. His inputs really pulled me through and let me focus only on the areas that I needed to improve on.

I got first place in the regionals again, and the second place guy is called Advaith. He's important too (but not in this article; we basically become best friends over the course of the next few months).

Nationals come by (happening in Delhi again), and the pressure is high. I really _really_ want to represent India, but so does everyone else. Suddenly it's results day and we're all sitting, eagerly waiting to see which one of us won.

The results are called out in alphabetical order of skill, and web development starts with a 'W'. Of course it does.

We patiently wait, butterflies in our stomachs. Just as our skills is about to be called, in the most anticlimactic fashion possible, the ceremony gets paused for a five-minute break.

The ceremony resumes and... I win!
